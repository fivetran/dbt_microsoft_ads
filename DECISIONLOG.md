# Decision Log 

## URL tagging 
By default, Microsoft Ads does not enable autotagging. The `microsoft_ads__url_report` leverages logic to observe this default behavior but also allows for customers to leverage the `microsoft_ads_auto_tagging_enabled` variable for UTM parameters either through the Microsoft auto tag feature or other means of URL tagging simultaneously. For more information, please refer to Microsoft's [documentation](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/ads/en/56798/2-500).
