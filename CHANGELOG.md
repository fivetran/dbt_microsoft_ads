# dbt_microsoft_ads v0.5.1

## ðŸª³BugfixðŸª³
[PR #17](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_microsoft_ads/pull/17) incorporates the below bugfixes:
- In v0.5.0, including a join on `keyword_performance_daily_report` caused an unintentional fanout in the `microsoft_ads__url_report` model. We have removed this join and rolled back to the previous logic, which is to use the following logic to extract `utm_term` (Microsoft Ads v0.4.0):
  - `{{ dbt_utils.get_url_parameter('ads.final_url', 'utm_term') }} as utm_term`

# dbt_microsoft_ads v0.5.0
## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes 
[PR #15](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_microsoft_ads/pull/15) incorporates these breaking changes:
- `microsoft_ads__ad_adapter` report has been renamed to `microsoft_ads__url_report` to more accurately reflect contents of report.
## ðŸŽ‰ Feature Enhancements ðŸŽ‰
[PR #15](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_microsoft_ads/pull/15) includes the below updates:
- Models have been updated to use level specific performance reporting for more accurate reporting.
- New models have been added:
  - `microsoft_ads__ad_report`
  - `microsoft_ads__keyword_report`
  - `microsoft_ads__search_report`
- New fields have been added to old models.
- `README` updates for easier navigation and use of the package.
- Inclusion of passthrough metrics:
  - `microsoft_ads__account_passthrough_metrics`
  - `microsoft_ads__campaign_passthrough_metrics`
  - `microsoft_ads__ad_group_passthrough_metrics`
  - `microsoft_ads__ad_passthrough_metrics`
  - `microsoft_ads__keyword_passthrough_metrics`
  - `microsoft_ads__search_passthrough_metrics`
> This applies to all passthrough columns within the `dbt_microsoft_ads` package and not just the `microsoft_ads__ad_passthrough_metrics` example.
```yml
vars:
  microsoft_ads__ad_passthrough_metrics:
    - name: "my_field_to_include" # Required: Name of the field within the source.
      alias: "field_alias" # Optional: If you wish to alias the field within the staging model.
```
- Added testing for better data integrity.
# dbt_microsoft_ads v0.4.1
## Updates
- We have migrated URL and UTM logic into the "modeling" package in order to adhere to our definitions of "source" and "modeling" packages; specifically, "source" packages are meant to only do light renaming and subsetting columns from the source while "modeling" packages perform more complex transformations, including string extraction for new fields. 
- Changes include:
  - added `int_microsoft_ads__ad_history` model where logic was previously found in the source package's `stg_microsoft_ads__ad_history` model
  - added `microsoft_auto_tagging_enabled` conditional statements for users who utilize Microsoft Advertising's auto tagging feature. Please check README.md for how to use this feature.

# dbt_microsoft_ads v0.4.0
ðŸŽ‰ dbt v1.0.0 Compatibility ðŸŽ‰
## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
- Adjusts the `require-dbt-version` to now be within the range [">=1.0.0", "<2.0.0"]. Additionally, the package has been updated for dbt v1.0.0 compatibility. If you are using a dbt version <1.0.0, you will need to upgrade in order to leverage the latest version of the package.
  - For help upgrading your package, I recommend reviewing this GitHub repo's Release Notes on what changes have been implemented since your last upgrade.
  - For help upgrading your dbt project to dbt v1.0.0, I recommend reviewing dbt-labs [upgrading to 1.0.0 docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/guides/migration-guide/upgrading-to-1-0-0) for more details on what changes must be made.
- Upgrades the package dependency to refer to the latest `dbt_microsoft_ads_source`. Additionally, the latest `dbt_microsoft_ads_source` package has a dependency on the latest `dbt_fivetran_utils`. Further, the latest `dbt_fivetran_utils` package also has a dependency on `dbt_utils` [">=0.8.0", "<0.9.0"].
  - Please note, if you are installing a version of `dbt_utils` in your `packages.yml` that is not in the range above then you will encounter a package dependency error.
