# Microsoft Advertising 

This package models Microsoft Advertising data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/microsoft-advertising). It uses data in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/microsoft-advertising#schemainformation).

The main focus of the package is to transform the core ad object tables into analytics-ready models, including an 'ad adapter' model that can be easily unioned in to other ad platform packages to get a single-view. This is especially easy using our [Ad Reporting package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting).

## Models

This package contains transformation models that are designed to work simultaneously with our [Microsoft Advertising source package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_microsoft_ads_source) and our [multi-platform Ad Reporting package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting). A dependency on the source package is declared in this package's `packages.yml` file, so it will automatically download when you run `dbt deps`. The primary outputs of this package are described below.

| **model**                      | **description**                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| microsoft_ads__ad_adapter      | Each record represents the daily ad performance of each ad, including information about the used UTM parameters. |
| microsoft_ads__account_report  | Each record represents the daily ad performance of each account.                                                 |
| microsoft_ads__ad_group_report | Each record represents the daily ad performance of each ad group.                                                |
| microsoft_ads__campaign_report | Each record represents the daily ad performance of each campaign.                                                |

## Installation Instructions
Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions, or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.

Include in your `packages.yml`

```yaml
packages:
  - package: fivetran/microsoft_ads
    version: [">=0.4.0", "<0.5.0"]
```

## Configuration
By default, this package looks for your Microsoft Advertising data in the `microsoft_ads` schema of your [target database](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/running-a-dbt-project/using-the-command-line-interface/configure-your-profile). If this is not where your Microsoft Advertising data is, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
    microsoft_ads_schema: your_schema_name
    microsoft_ads_database: your_database_name
```

For additional configurations for the source models, visit the [Microsoft Advertising source package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_microsoft_ads_source).

### UTM Auto Tagging Feature
This package assumes you are manually adding UTM tags to the `final_url` field within the `ad_history` table. If you are leveraging the auto-tag feature within Microsoft Ads then you will want to enable the `microsoft_auto_tagging_enabled` variable to correctly populate the UTM fields within the `int_microsoft_ads__ad_history` model.
```yml
vars:
  microsoft_auto_tagging_enabled: true # False by default
```

### Changing the Build Schema
By default this package will build the Microsoft Ads staging models within a schema titled (<target_schema> + `_stg_microsoft_ads`) and the Microsoft Ads final models with a schema titled (<target_schema> + `_microsoft_ads`) in your target database. If this is not where you would like your modeled Microsoft Ads data to be written to, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
models:
  microsoft_ads:
    +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
  microsoft_ads_source:
    +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
```
## Database Support

This package has been tested on BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, Postgres, and Databricks.

### Databricks Dispatch Configuration
dbt `v0.20.0` introduced a new project-level dispatch configuration that enables an "override" setting for all dispatched macros. If you are using a Databricks destination with this package you will need to add the below (or a variation of the below) dispatch configuration within your `dbt_project.yml`. This is required in order for the package to accurately search for macros within the `dbt-labs/spark_utils` then the `dbt-labs/dbt_utils` packages respectively.
```yml
# dbt_project.yml

dispatch:
  - macro_namespace: dbt_utils
    search_order: ['spark_utils', 'dbt_utils']
```
